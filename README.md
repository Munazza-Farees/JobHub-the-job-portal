# JobHub - The Job Portal


## Overview

**JobHub** is a job portal designed to connect job seekers with employers. It provides a platform for users to browse job listings, apply for jobs, and for employers to post job openings. The project is structured with separate backend and frontend components to ensure a scalable and maintainable architecture.

## Features

_Job Listings_: Browse and search for job opportunities.\
_User Profiles_: Create and manage profiles for job seekers and employers.\
_Application System_: Apply for jobs directly through the portal.\
_Employer Dashboard_: Post and manage job listings.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:\
_backend_: Contains the server-side logic, APIs, and database configurations.\
_frontend_: Contains the client-side code, including UI components and front-end logic.
